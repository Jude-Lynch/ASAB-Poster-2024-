# asab_spring_2024
Reproduces information and plots for ASAB Spring 2024 presentations.

## Code
Here are the code files:
1. Conversion: In this case, it is used to convert Israeli Transverse Mercator (ITM) coordinates (X,Y) into GPS coordinates (lon-lat) to better fit the 
               swaRmverse package. This script can be manipulated for other Mercators. 
2. Poster: This is a large GGPLOT script to produce a clearer PCA plot with legend, plot and axis labels as well as keys for species in the swaRmspace.
3. Script_Main: The script used to create my bats_vs_pigeons swaRmspace.
