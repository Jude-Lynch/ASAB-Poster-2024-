~ Consists of 2 complete homing flights from Nagy et al., 2010 as well as 5 homing flights conducted for the purpose fo the study in Seuzach, Switzerland. 
~ GPS data collected included time-stamped longitude and latitude data with a resolution of 0.25 s. 
~ Nagy et al. 2010, used 5 Hz, 16 g GPS loggers, attached via backpack elastic harnesses. Santos et al., 2014 used 4 Hz, 25 g GPS loggers (GiPSy1, Technosmart, Italy).

~ Thresholds: Speed = 15, Polarization = 0.97. 18 events over 78.9 mins.  

Columba livia (Sankey (P/C)):

~ Collected pre-proccessed trajectories of flocks of homing pigeons from by Sankey et al. (2021). 
~ All individuals were trained to fly back to their home when released at a site 5km away. 
~ Use of robotic falcon (built and designed to look like a peregrine falcon) as a predator to chase homing flights, this device also had a GPS attached to it. 
~ GPS data loggers had a resolution of 0.2s. 

~ Thresholds:
> Predator: Speed = 15, Polarization = 0.97. 29 events over 16.48 mins 
> Control: Speed = 15, Polarization = 0.97. 16 events over 8.85 mins

~ Data consists of 13 homing pigeons, 1- 5 years old, that have homing experience. Trained to carry GPS data loggers via habituation to 16g 'dummy GPS' weights. The flights used in the Swarm Space were the homing flights (hf), of which there are four. 
~ GPS devices logged 32 hours of flight time. 5 Hz, 16 g GPS loggers, attached via backpack elastic harnesses. 
~ hf was put into 1 dataset using rbind().

~ Thresholds: 
> hf1: Speed = 15, Polarization = 0.85. 17 events over 6.65 mins 
> hf2: Speed = 15, Polarization = 0.97. 5 events over 14.03 mins
> hf3: Speed = 15, Polarization = 0.95. 11 events over 3.77 mins 
> hf4: Speed = 15%, Polarization = 0.95. 7 events over 14.72 mins
